# Learning estimators for the entropy production
## 1. About
You can estimate the entropy production rate and thermodynamic force from trajectory data.
This is a rearranged version of the code used in the following papers:  
- [Otsubo, Ito, Dechant, and Sagawa, Phys. Rev. E 101, 062106, 2020](https://journals.aps.org/pre/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevE.101.062106).
- [Otsubo, Sreekanth, Sagawa, and Krishnamurthy, arXiv:2010.03852, 2020](https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.03852).

## 2. How to use
The code is written with Python3, and depends on the following libraries.
- torch, numpy, matplotlib, pillow
